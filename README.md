Evaluating the claims of https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09430
Two-factor evaluation:
1. Does a radial bias in the means and variances of the gaussian kernels used emerge to optimise object recognition independent of the visual search task?
2. Does the fovea-periphery organisation reflect a computational contraint or a computational principle?
